        <p> This is a video created for the final submission of my animation
          class on the fundamentals of animation. I love musical theater and
          had been listening to a lot of music from the Dear Evan Hansen
          soundtrack at the time. I also knew that I wanted my final project to
          include lipsync, as I really enjoy the technical nature of the
          lipsyncing process along with the artistic choices of character
          posing and facial expression. </p>
