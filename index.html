            My first experience with coding was in my senior year of high
            school in Bronxville, NY. I fell in love with the juxtaposition
            of order and originality that comes with developement and design.

            I've been drawing since I was little, and one of the most important aspects of art
            is that of composition, which is also critical to design. Graphic design gave me a
            medium to flex my creative muscles in a way that varies from traditional fine art.

            I love solving puzzles, as you can see with my growing colection of rubix cubes.
            I think that the best part of developement is the creativity it takes to solve a complex problem,
            and the satisfaction when what you've worked so hard to create is finished and working properly.
            The beauty of design is that you can make that finished project unmistakably your own.

            The Lab also looks like such a fun and inspiring place to work!
